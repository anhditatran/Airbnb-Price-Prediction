## Airbnb Supply–Demand & Pricing Analysis

This project analyzes **213,000+ Airbnb listings across 16 U.S. cities** to understand how **supply, demand, and market structure** drive short-term rental prices. The focus is on identifying **pricing drivers, supply constraints, and revenue opportunities** rather than just prediction.

---
## Business Questions

* What factors most strongly influence Airbnb prices?
* How does **listing density (supply)** affect pricing and competition?
* Which markets are most sensitive to **demand shocks** (e.g., major events)?
* Where do pricing upside and volatility risks emerge?
---
## Approach
* Cleaned and engineered features from large-scale listing data
* Analyzed price distributions and competition across markets
* Built models for interpretability and prediction:

  * OLS, Ridge, Lasso (price drivers & elasticities)
  * Random Forest (nonlinear effects)
* Simulated **event-driven demand shocks** using the 2026 FIFA World Cup
---
## Key Insights

* **Supply density strongly shapes pricing behavior**: oversupplied markets show higher price dispersion and weaker upside.
* Capacity and amenities set baseline prices; **location and competition determine revenue potential**.
* Demand shocks can drive **short-term price surges (up to ~80%)** in supply-constrained cities.
* Random Forest captured complex interactions between capacity, location, and market structure.

---

## Business Value

* Supports **dynamic pricing and revenue optimization**
* Identifies markets with **supply risk and demand opportunity**
* Informs **market entry, expansion, and event planning decisions**
---
## Tools

Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), R, Tableau, statistical modeling, data visualization

---
## Takeaway
This project shows how **applied analytics** can explain **supply–demand dynamics**, quantify pricing risk, and support **real marketplace decisions**.
